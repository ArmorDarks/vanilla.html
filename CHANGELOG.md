- [sass] Scopes `s-` moved into own directory `scopes`
- [sass] Content of `site-header.scss`, `site-main.scss` and `site-footer.scss` refactored into standalone components and moved into `components` directory. All related class names has been changed to follow components naming convention
- [sass] For sake of simplicity, `&--is-active` convention changed to `&.is-active`. This is smaller evil we have to accept, otherwise it's a nightmare to apply active state with JavaScript
- [sass] Moved `layouts` into `pages` directory
- [sass] Changed namespace for pages from `.l-` to `.p-`
- [sass] Site-specific `html` and `body` classes moved into `base/_root.scss`
- [sass] `.Wrapper` split into `.Wrapper`, which defines only paddings, and `.Wrapper--contain` modifiers, which applies min and max width on element
- [sass] Moved width styles from `.s-blog-post` into standalone `.Wrapper--readable` which defines max-width for approximately 80 chars per line

- [nj] All current examples moved to new Examples page. Still quite messy and limited, but better than nothing

- [nj][breaking] `breadcrumb()` macro will no longer generate `magic` classes like `{{ mainCLass }}__link`. Instead, you will need to specify all classes explicetely with new arguments:
  * `class` for root class;
  * `itemsClass` for all `<li>` classes;
  * `anchorsClass` for all `<a>` inside `<li>`;
  * `rootItemClass` for class of `<li>`, which will be root (first);
  * `rootAnchorClass` for class of `<a>` inside `<li>`, which will be root (first).

- [nj][breaking] `menu()` macro will no longer generate `magic` classes too. New arguments:
  * `class` for root list class;
  * `itemsClass` for all `<li>` classes;
  * `anchorsClass` for all `<a>` inside `<li>`;
  * `activeClass` for class of active `<li>`

- [nj] Components filenames changed to use PascalCase, same as components declarations
- [nj] Changed the way how headings used. `<h1>` from now used only for main title of the page, and it is no longer recommended to use `<h1>` as root heading of nested sections for now, since no user agent those days support proper HTML Outlines. See details [here](http://html5doctor.com/computer-says-no-to-html5-document-outline/).
- [nj] All pages global variables, which have been used for configuration, have been replaced with `config('page', { ... })` expression which works similar to `grunt.config()`

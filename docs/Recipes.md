## _I have an issue with content duplication caused by dynamic parameters (query)_

Kotsu already eases the pain with providing for each page self-referencing canonical URL.

See [#326](https://github.com/LotusTM/Kotsu/issues/326) for other options.

## _I need to validate some data_

We already shipping with Kotsu [tcomb](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb) which is great way to make most validations.

However, if you need more, check [#165](https://github.com/LotusTM/Kotsu/issues/165) for options.

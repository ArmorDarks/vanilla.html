  * `rootItemClass` for class of `<li>`, which will be root (first);
  * `rootAnchorClass` for class of `<a>` inside `<li>`, which will be root (first).

- [nj][breaking] `menu()` macro will no longer generate `magic` classes too. New arguments:
  * `class` for root list class;
  * `itemsClass` for all `<li>` classes;
  * `anchorsClass` for all `<a>` inside `<li>`;
  * `activeClass` for class of active `<li>`
